Quantitative Finance / Machine Learning  / Data Science/ Skills Challenge "Employing Pairs Trading with the application of Machine Learning

Your Mission:
The following assignment is an opportunity for you to highlight your skillset and show us what you are made of! It tests your ability to implement research, and to do it in style!

Briefing
Read the following paper: Enhancing a Pairs Trading strategy with the application of Machine Learning.

Note: The following textbook provides a deeper explanation of the technique.

In a Jupyter Notebook (python):

Create a private repo on Github for your submission. Use your full name as the repo name.
Download and save your universe of stocks (use 200-300 shares) (Can use Yahoo finance to get shares data. Checkout the yfinance package.)(Else you can use Polygon)
Implement Section III: Proposed Pairs Selection Framework (A and B, Section C if you really want to impress)
Create a set of functions/class for the end-user to make use of.
Make sure to add docstrings and follow PEP8 code style checks. Have plenty of inline comments, good variable names and don't over complicate things unnecessarily. It should be easy for the user to make use of.
Showcase your new Pairs Selection Framework in a Jupyter Notebook and show us some visualizations of the clusters and pairs (Think Plotly and Dash).
Add an introduction, body, and conclusion showcasing your new implementation. (Use the correct style headers)
Invite us (research@hudsonthames.org) to your private repo so that we can evaluate your work.
Bonus points if you add unit tests (in a separate .py file).
